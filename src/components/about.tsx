          Hello! I&apos;m David, a backend developer passionate about building
          robust and scalable server-side applications. My journey in tech is
          driven by a love for solving complex problems and architecting
          efficient, high-performance systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my expertise lies in backend technologies, I also have a strong
          appreciation for the user experience and enjoy working with modern
          frontend frameworks like React and Next.js to bring ideas to life.
          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails
          or working on personal projects.
